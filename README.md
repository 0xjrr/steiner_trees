## Steiner Tree Problem in Graphs

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that addresses the Steiner Tree Problem, a classic NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization and graph theory. The notebook includes various methods for solving and approximating the Steiner Tree Problem, including brute force, depth-first search (DFS), greedy DFS, and the Mehlhorn approximation algorithm.

### Contents

- **Introduction**: Overview of the Steiner Tree Problem and its significance in graph theory.
- **Algorithms**: Implementation of different algorithms to solve the Steiner Tree Problem.
  - Brute Force Algorithm
  - DFS Algorithm
  - Greedy DFS Algorithm
  - Mehlhorn Approximation Algorithm
- **Use Cases**: Applications of the Steiner Tree Problem in real-world scenarios such as network design and electricity distribution.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparison of the algorithms in terms of efficiency and accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of the Steiner Tree solutions for better understanding.

### Purpose
